# A-Good-Repo
A really good repository, for educational purposes only.

## Purpose
This repo was created to help Resonace's students protect themselves from their parents/guardians/teachers/etc.
Main purpose of this repo is to help people. I, Sparkly, do not intend to cause any harm of any kind, to anyone.

## You don't have a mobile? No worries!
In this repo, you can access detailed tutorials for bypassing the official exam site's security, so that you won't even need a mobile phone to crack your exams.

## Note
If you are gonna use your PC for the tutorials, make sure you have a good typing speed.
About 30-40 AWPM should be enough. More is better.
